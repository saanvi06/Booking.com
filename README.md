Install Node.js and Cypress to run the test
I performed the test by installing cypress by directly downloading from CDN location. 

But, if you prefer to install Node.js then cypress can be installed via the following commands
Install Cypress via npm:

cd /your/project/path
npm install cypress --save-dev
